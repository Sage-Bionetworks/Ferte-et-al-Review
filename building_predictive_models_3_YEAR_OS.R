# code to develop the model in the Director's dataset (TS) and validate it in the Zhu dataset (VS)
# we want to predict the 3 year propbability of OS

# load the packages that are neeeded

# load the data from synapse

# first build the model based on clin variables only (linear regression)

# second build the model based on linear regression of clin + ge features

# thrird build the model based on clin + molecular features using elasticnet

# thrird build the model based on clin + molecular features using RandomForest

# adress the results of in the VS using ROC curves

# adress the same results of AUC in boxplots with their IC95
