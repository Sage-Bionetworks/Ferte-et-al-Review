# first build the model based on clin variables only (linear regression)

# second build the model based on linear regression of clin + ge features

# thrird build the model based on clin + molecular features using elasticnet

# thrird build the model based on clin + molecular features using RandomForest

# adress the results of in the VS using ROC curves

# adress the same results of AUC in boxplots with their IC95
